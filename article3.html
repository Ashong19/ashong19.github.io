                        <h1>10 Best HTML Editors</h1> <!-- Article Title -->
                        <p class="fs-6 mb-5"><i>Publish by Cali Bear | January 4, 2024</i></p> <!-- Author -->
                        <p>As previously touched upon, an HTML editor is a program that’s specially designed for coding HTML and possibly CSS, or a variety of other programming languages. It includes features that streamline your coding workflow.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Features of an HTML Text Editor</h3>
                        <p>HTML text editor can include many potential features such as:</p>
                        <ul class="p-5">
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Syntax highlighter</b>– A feature that emphasizes key elements in different colors so it’s easier to keep track of your code. You’re able to visually differentiate between the elements so you can quickly determine what you need to write next.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Auto-completion</b>– Components such as closing tags are automatically inserted when they’re logically supposed to appear. It saves you time automating a good chunk of your code.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                
                                <p><b>Debugging</b>– An HTML text editor sometimes can include a debugging feature. It checks your code for errors and reports them back to you. It saves you from having to comb through line after line of code trying to see and fix tiny errors that are easy to miss.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Code validation</b>– Some of the available text editors for HTML options include built-in code validation. This is a feature that checks to make sure your code’s syntax is error-free. While it won’t check for more complex errors like a debugging tool would, it’s still a useful feature. It saves you time in a similar way to a debugging tool.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Insert common HTML elements</b>– with one click, you can quickly add HTML elements without having to constantly type them in every time you want to use them, saving you time.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                
                                <p><b>A quick search of code</b>– Instead of looking through hundreds of lines of code for one component, this feature lets you search for it. Each instance of the keyword you typed gets highlighted in your code so you can quickly find what you need.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p> <b>Search and replace </b>– This feature lets you not only search your code, but you can change all instances of your searched keywords to something else. You only have to type the replacement code once instead of multiple times.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3><b>When Do You Need an HTML Editor?</b></h3>
                        <p>Sometimes you may need an HTML editor or an HTML WYSIWYG editor, and other times you need a different option such as a word processor or an IDE. Here are general guidelines that can help you determine which type of software you need.</p>
                        <p>An HTML editor is helpful when:</p>
                        <ul class="p-5">
                            <li>You’re learning to code HTML.</li>
                            <li>You need to edit an HTML or CSS file.</li>
                            <li>It’s essential to efficiently write HTML or other design-based code like CSS.</li>
                            <li>You need a professional tool that helps you reduce errors in your code.</li>
                            <li>A basic word processor or text editor just isn’t cutting it for you anymore.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you need to quickly generate HTML without touching code, an HTML WYSIWYG editor is the best option.</p>

                        <p>Keep in mind that the best HTML editors and any HTML editor, really, are best suited for front-end web development. If you’re looking for an HTML text editor that you can use for back-end development, you’re better off using an IDE in most cases.</p>
